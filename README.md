# _React Tic-Tac-Toe_

_December 1 2020_

#### _A tic-tac-toe game built with React_

#### By _**Johnny Duverseau, Vanessa Stewart, and Ophelia Swen**_

## Description

_This is a project for Epicodus to practice building React apps and refactoring them with Redux. The original instructions include:_

Create a React and Redux application that allows users to play tic-tac-toe. Begin by following this highly-recommended tutorial from the React documentation that walks through the creation of a non-Redux tic-tac-toe game.

Even though you already know how to make non-Redux React apps, take your time and pay careful attention to each step of this tutorial. The tutorial includes shortcuts and pieces of functionality we haven't covered such as creating helper methods to dynamically render JSX.

Once you've successfully completed the tutorial, add Redux and React-Redux to your tic-tac-toe game and refactor the application to rely solely on Redux for all application state management.

## User Stories
| #    | Story |
| ---- | ----- | 
| 1 | Users should be able to click on a game board square and see an X or O appear based on the current turn. | 
| 2 | Users should be able to see whose turn it is displayed above the game board. | 
| 3 | Users should be able to see a history of moves to the right of the game board. | 
| 4 | Users should be able to click on one of the moves in the history to reload the game board at that current move. | 
| 5 | When users click on a move from the history to reload the board, and then click on the game board to make another move, the game board should erase all future moves from the history and record the new move. |
